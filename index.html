                    <article>I was born in Richmond, Virginia but moved to a small town in the Shenandoah Valley when I was five
                        and spent my school years there. I eventually wound up back in Richmond, Virginia as a student at
                        Virginia
                        Commonwealth University. I graduated from there in 2008 during the height of the economic downturn and
                        the only job I could find at the time with my very practical Art History BA was a management gig at a
                        Sherwin Williams paint store.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It worked for me for about a decade but I rapidly became burnt out over the last few years. After
                        exploring
                        various paths out of that career and into something better, it became clear to me that the Coding
                        Bootcamp at the University of Richmond was the place for me. Now I'm plugging my way through the class
                        and can confidently say that this was probably one of my better life decisions. I've since quit my old
                        job and won't ever look back. I couldn't be happier with my decision to enter this program.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When I'm not punching away at my keyboard for the Bootcamp, I find myself usually up to my eyes in old
                        vinyl records. I'd always been a collector of some sort as a kid; whether it be comics, baseball cards
                        or even baseball caps. I was always accumulating something. I had always enjoyed listening to music more
                        than most so the marriage of my love of music and my collecting gene would eventually culminate in an
                        obsessive record collecting habbit in my late teens that's lasted to this current day at the age of 36.
                        I'm not a hoarder by any means as I do have a focus in my collecting. Genre wise I focus mainly on jazz,
                        soul, funk and rock from the 60s and 70s; generally of the weirder and obscure variety. I've also
                        drifted in interest towards the no hit wonders of Virginia and spend a lot of time and money tracking
                        down their original pressings and sometimes even discovering incredible long forgotten recordings. It's
                        a fun hobby and has gotten me invited to dj in numerous cities in the US and Europe and the opportunity
                        to meet lots of interesting people.
